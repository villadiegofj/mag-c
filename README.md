**My Amateur Gaming Collection** (using ncurses in C++)

Just a little side project I did, when I was getting bored at home during holidays due to Internet ban in my region as per government order. 

**Note:** Make sure you've got [ncurses](https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/announce.html) library in your system.

I've added makefile for easy installation.
Just run 
```make```
in the respective directory.

If you it doesn't work, you might need to install build essential / development tools / it's equivalent for your distribution.

Btw, compilation command goes like
```g++ home.cpp -o home -lncurses```
