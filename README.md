<h2>My Amateur Gaming Collection<h2> (using ncurses in C++)

Just a little side project I did, when I was getting bored at home during holidays due to Internet ban in my region as per government order. 

<h3>Note:<h3> Make sure you've got <a href="https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/announce.html">ncurses</a> library in your system.

I've added makefile for easy installation.
Just run 
<addr> make
in the respective directory.

If you it doesn't work, you might need to install build essential / development tools / it's equivalent for your distribution.

Btw, compilation command goes like
<addr> g++ home.cpp -o home -lncurses
